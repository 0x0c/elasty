# elasty

A research-oriented elastic body simulator

## Algorithms

### Frameworks

- [x] Position-based dynamics (PBD) [Muller et al. 2007]
- [ ] Extended position-based dynamics (XPBD) [Macklin et al. 2016]
- [ ] Projective dynamics [Bouaziz et al. 2014]
- [ ] Quasi-Newton dynamics [Liu et al. 2017]
